<h1>Gerald<br>https://gvrousto.github.io/Gerald-Frontend/</h1>
Gerald will gather the last 10 photos found on an instagram profile using python3 and BeautifulSoup and then send those photos up to the Clarifai api in order to get some common themes in the pictures. From there it will be sent up to the frontend page using flask (backend) and js (frontend) in order to display it to the users.
